  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    How many of us face problems when your Apple Watch asks you to stand up when you are already standing? Well, that happens to me! 
    ... Or even when you're on a motored two-wheeler (motorbike, etc.), and the Watch or the phone detects that you are cycling. 
    That is a Machine Learning algorithm wrongly detecting similar actions, along with change in location.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Machine Learning projects looks at all preliminary actions humans would perform - sitting, standing, laying, walking, 
    walking downstairs, and walking upstairs. With multiple models used, their accuracy is compared, and wrongly recognised actions 
    are compared to assess why they might be wrongly recognised. Is there something wrong with the data, or is that the actions are 
    very similar which makes it challenging for models to distinguish?

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üß© Project Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To recognise, using Machine Learning, the actions were detected correctly.</li>
      <li>To quantify accuracy and assess falsely detected classification.</li>
      <li>To consider and discuss options to improve the accuracy of models.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è My Implementation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Collected data with x parameters/features.</li>
      <li>The data is fairly clean, so no data cleaning was performed.</li>
      <li>Trained <code>LinearRegression</code> model using scikit-learn.</li>
      <li>Evaluated the model with RMSE, R¬≤ score, and confusion matrix.</li>
    </ol>

    <pre><code>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)</code></pre>

    <h2>‚úèÔ∏è What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analysing and comparing different models, especially voting algorithms, where I used a combination of ML models.</li>
      <li>To recognise wrongly predicted classifications and assess why these were wrongly assessed.</li>
      <li>Next step: Options to improve the model or the data.</li>
